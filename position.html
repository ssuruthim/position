        <b>POSITION:RELATIVE</b> An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
